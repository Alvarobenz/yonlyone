pivot value = array.size/2 

If the array 0 >= pivot >= array -1
  then you swap them
Elif array[ 0 + 1] and [-1 - 1]

If number_guess > um_act
  output =  Lower
If number_guess < num_act
  output =  Higher

If num_act > num(num.size/2)

 x = list.size/2
While (act_num =! i )

  for as long as act num > num(x)
    x = x + x/2
    
  for as long as act num < num(x)
    x = x/2
